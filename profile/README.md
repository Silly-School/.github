# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### What is this organization all about?

Basically, all my school projects will be on here. From C to C# and Web development with NodeJS and more!

This isn't a "school" by any means, this organization will **not teach you** how to do certain stuff. It is just my way to organize all my school projects and share them with the world if someone is interested!
